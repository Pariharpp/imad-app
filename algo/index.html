	     India, also known as Bharat, is a Union of States. It is a Sovereign Socialist Secular Democratic Republic with a<br>parliamentary system of government. The Republic is governed in terms of the Constitution of India which was adopted by the<br>Constituent Assembly on 26th November, 1949 and came into force on 26th January, 1950. The Constitution provides for a Parliamentary<br>form of government which is federal in structure with certain unitary features. The constitutional head of the Executive of the Union<br>is the President. As per Article 79 of the Constitution of India,the council of the Parliament of the Union consists of the President<br>and two Houses known as the Council of State(Rajya Sabha) and the House of the People (Lok Sabha). Article 74(1) of the<br>Constitution provides that there shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as its head to aid and advise the President,<br>who shall exercise his/her functions in accordance to the advice. The real executive power is thus vested in the Council of<br>Ministers with the Prim Minister as its head.<br>
